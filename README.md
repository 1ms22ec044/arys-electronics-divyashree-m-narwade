Arys Garage â€“ Electronics Assignment
This repository contains the deliverables for the Arys Garage Electronics Assignment, which consists of three main tasks: a Battery Management System (BMS) with CAN communication, a SystemVerilog-based Fault Detection FSM, and a DC-DC Buck Converter design.

Tools & Technologies:
MATLAB/Simulink: Used for developing and simulating the BMS and CAN communication models.
Simscape Battery Toolbox: Utilized for modeling cell-level behavior and creating the 2s2p battery pack.
Vehicle Network Toolbox: Employed for CAN protocol integration and communication.
SystemVerilog: The hardware description language used to design the fault detection FSM.
EDA Playground: The online platform used for FSM design and verification.

Q1 - Battery Management System
This folder contains the MATLAB/Simulink files and plots for the BMS and CAN bus integration. 
It includes the main simulation model for the 2s2p battery pack , and models for various BMS functions like fault detection, passive cell balancing, thermal management, and CAN communication.

Q2 - HDL Fault Detection FSM
This folder includes the design and testbench code, simulation waveforms, state transition diagram and the testbench results.
The FSM is implemented with synchronous logic, including features like a masking register, debounce, and persistence counters.

Q3 - DC-DC Buck Converter
This folder contains the schematic for the 12V to 5V buck converter.

For more details on the design methodology and implementation, please refer to the full assignment report.
